This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Database Setup and Prediction Pipeline

### Setting up the Database

To set up the database, run the following command:

```bash
node setupDatabase.js
```

This script will create the necessary tables and insert sample data into the database.

### Running the Prediction Pipeline

To generate and add readiness predictions to the database, run the following command:

```bash
python src/scripts/readiness_prediction_pipeline.py
```

This script will generate mock predictions and add them to the database using the `add_readiness_predictions.py` script.
